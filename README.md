# Cryptography
Crypto algorithms - Not to be relied upon: Purely for learning purposes.

S-DES: shows the basic properties of the DES encryption algorithm. Main class will run test data over encryption scheme.

Also contains a project that is built using these algorithms. A secure login server which makes use of hybrid key cryptogrpahy, keystroke dynamics and server logging.
